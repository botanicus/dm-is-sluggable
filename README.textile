This is plugin for easy creating unique slugs from other properties.


h1. Initialization

You need to have DataMapper model with property slug. To set slug just use before create hook with set_slug model method. This method takes the slug as parameter. Use String#to_slug to get this parameter if you need.

<pre>
class Post
  include DataMapper::Resource
  is :sluggable
  property :title, String
  property :slug,  String, :key => true
  before :create do
    set_slug(self.title.to_slug)
  end
end
</pre>

So what exactly set_slug does? It look for given slug, if not found than save it, let say as "foo-bar". If found, than increase number of iteraction and tries it again with "foo-bar-2".
